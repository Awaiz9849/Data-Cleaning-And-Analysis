picked the data set kaggle and cleaned and processed.
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and cleaned and processed using Microsoft Excel. Initially, the data was reviewed for completeness and consistency. Missing values were identified using Excelâ€™s Filter and Conditional Formatting tools. For numerical columns, missing entries were filled using the average or median of the column, while missing text values were replaced with "Unknown" or an appropriate default. Duplicate rows were removed using the Remove Duplicates function to ensure data integrity.

Text inconsistencies, such as varied capitalization or spelling errors, were corrected using Find and Replace and LOWER/UPPER functions. Date columns were reformatted using Excel's Date functions to ensure consistency. Outliers were detected using basic statistics like mean and standard deviation, and highlighted via Conditional Formatting or filtered manually.

For transformation, new columns were created using formulas such as TEXT, LEFT/RIGHT, or IF statements to extract or categorize data. Categorical data was standardized, and numerical columns were normalized where necessary using basic arithmetic formulas.

After processing, the dataset was reviewed for accuracy and exported as a clean Excel file, ready for further analysis or visualization. This approach ensured a well-structured and reliable dataset suitable for insights or reporting.
